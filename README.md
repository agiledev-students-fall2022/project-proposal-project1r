# Project Proposal

## Project Title: 
Let's Work 

## What and Why: 
The software system would be an application that improves the current way NYU students receive announcements about jobs, research, and educational opportunities via the NYU CS mailing list. 
The motivation behind the project is that the current mailing list (opportunities@cs.nyu.edu) and archive is not very user-friendly as the emails usually have signifcant extraneous details outside the announcement and an email is sent for each new announcement which indundates the inbox and may get skipped over. Thus, these great opportunities may not be reaching students and getting fulfilled. 
The application would streamline access to and applying for these positions by having both features on a single platform. 

## For Whom: 
The app would aim to serve 2 main user groups. (1) NYU students who are looking for job, research, or educational opportunities. (2) Opportunity providers such as professors, alumni, recruiters who can make the posting and review applicants directly on the platform. 
Another potential user group would be moderators who would verify and approve postings if this cannot be done in an automated way. 

## How: 
NYU students should be able to view the opportunity posting and apply directly through the application. There could also be a feature that enables students to see others interested in the position and work together to prepare for the position or interview ad hoc. 
The opportunity provider such as a professor looking for a research assistant or an alumnus offering their services for mock interviews would be able to create a post similar to the ones on job-posting sites and also review the submissions on the platform. 
There should also be a way to review the posting either in real-time or via a mod. 

## Scope: 
The project should be able to be completed in one semester by 4-6 programmers, but adjustments can be made to expand or scale down the features during the product backlog creation.
